# SCORER CALIBRATION: LOW QUALITY test (should score 3-4/10)
#
# Issues demonstrated (compare with good-pytest-test.py for correct version):
# ❌ Coverage: 1/2 - Missing some expected results, has TODOs for specified requirements,
#                    and skips a precondition the active feature MUST provide (should fail)
# ❌ Assertions: 0/2 - Generic "false-green" assertions, no messages, no feature-specific signal
# ❌ Conventions: 1/2 - Uses invented marker not in repo's pytest.ini
# ❌ Test Data: 0/2 - Uses placeholder "test-model" instead of exact ID from TC
# ❌ Code Quality: 0/2 - Excessive TODOs for things specified in TC, fabricated helper,
#                        unbounded stream loop, shell-injection in helper
#
# Tiger Team has no pytest rules yet - this calibration is standalone.
